O. J. Simpson was tried for the crime in a case that captured the attention of the American people, but he was ultimately found not guilty of criminal charges. The victims' families brought civil cases against Simpson, in which he was found liable for willfully and wrongfully causing the deaths of Ron and Nicole by committing battery with malice and oppression. <p> In 2006, HarperCollins announced the publication of a book in which O. J. Simpson told how he <i>hypothetically</i> would have committed the murders. In response to public outrage that Simpson stood to profit from these crimes, HarperCollins canceled the book. A Florida bankruptcy court awarded the rights to the Goldmans in August 2007 to partially satisfy the unpaid civil judgment, which has risen, with interest, to over $38 million.</p> <p> The Goldman family views this book as Simpson's confession, and has worked hard to ensure that the public will read or listen to this book and learn the truth. This audiobook was produced from the original manuscript approved by O. J. Simpson, with additional insight from the Goldman Family, Pablo F. Fenjves, and Dominick Dunne.</p>","releaseDate":"2007-10-15","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/002373/bk_blak_002373_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51HHbijhy7L","asin":"B002VA8Q6M","subHeading":"The Shocking Inside Story","title":"How I Helped O.

In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, National Book Award winner Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America.</p> <p>According to historian Joseph Ellis, Alexander Hamilton is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”</p> <p>Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time.</p> <p>“To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.</p> <p>Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.</p> <p>Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, Alexander Hamilton will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.</p>","releaseDate":"2004-12-26","publishers":[{"name":"Penguin Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Historical","url":"18571990011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/peng/000340/bk_peng_000340_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51jtNRtw9uL","asin":"B0044EMDEO","subHeading":"A Life","title":"Washington","authors":"Ron Chernow","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"41 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"517dEtb7gVL","asin":"B074F447V6","title":"Grant","authors":"Ron Chernow","narrators":"Mark Bramhall","length":"48 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"61cHf8fOqKL","asin":"B002VACOB0","title":"John Adams","authors":"David McCullough","narrators":"Nelson Runger","length":"29 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"51IqwZI02iL","asin":"B01B8IRSNY","subHeading":"The Revolution","title":"Hamilton","authors":"Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jeremy McCarter","narrators":"Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jeremy McCarter, Mariska Hargitay","length":"6 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51eWaPy86hL","asin":"B009R9KT74","title":"Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power","authors":"Jon Meacham","narrators":"Edward Herrmann, Jon Meacham","length":"18 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51mqtdkM6HL","asin":"B00ECGLKLG","subHeading":"The Life of John D.

An ear well-tuned to the nuances of vocabulary inoculates the hearer against this epidemic of deception. </p> <p>With nine new essays, dealing with subjects as diverse as deadlines, fancy words, the problems with ‘issue’, odd sounds, oxymorons, and the fallacy of ‘wading in’, this revised and expanded edition of <i>Wordwatching</i> is a fascinating demonstration of the power and the pleasure of the English language.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-12-18","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Education & Learning","url":"18573267011"},{"name":"Words, Language & Grammar","url":"18573336011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/021275/bk_adbl_021275_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"added":84},{"asin":"B013RGDL40","cover":"51tDtJdjCHL","title":"Becoming Fluent: How Cognitive Science Can Help Adults Learn a Foreign Language","authors":[{"name":"Richard Roberts","url":"B010ZDNHFQ"},{"name":"Roger Kreuz","url":"/search"}],"narrators":[{"name":"P.

Once they begin to learn a language, students may be further discouraged when they find the methods used to teach children don't seem to work for them. What is an adult language learner to do? </p> <p>In <i>Becoming Fluent</i>, Richard Roberts and Roger Kreuz draw on insights from psychology and cognitive science to show that adults can master a foreign language if they bring to bear the skills and knowledge they have honed over a lifetime. Adults shouldn't try to learn as children do, they should learn like adults. Roberts and Kreuz report evidence that adults can learn new languages even more easily than children. Children appear to have only two advantages over adults in learning a language: they acquire a native accent more easily, and they do not suffer from self-defeating anxiety about learning a language. Adults, on the other hand, have the greater advantages - gained from experience - of an understanding of their own mental processes and knowing how to use language to do things. Adults have an especially advantageous grasp of pragmatics, the social use of language, and Roberts and Kreuz show how to leverage this metalinguistic ability in learning a new language. </p> <p>Learning a language takes effort.

But as Norman Ohler reveals in this gripping new history, the Third Reich was saturated with drugs. On the eve of World War II, Germany was a pharmaceutical powerhouse, and companies such as Merck and Bayer cooked up cocaine, opiates, and, most of all, methamphetamines, to be consumed by everyone from factory workers to housewives to millions of German soldiers. In fact, troops regularly took rations of a form of crystal meth - the elevated energy and feelings of invincibility associated with the high even help to explain certain German military victories. </p> <p>Drugs seeped all the way up to the Nazi high command and, especially, to Hitler himself. Over the course of the war, Hitler became increasingly dependent on injections of a cocktail of drugs - including a form of heroin - administered by his personal doctor. While drugs alone cannot explain the Nazis' toxic racial theories or the events of World War II, Ohler's investigation makes an overwhelming case that, if drugs are not taken into account, our understanding of the Third Reich is fundamentally incomplete. Carefully researched and rivetingly listenable, <i>Blitzed</i> throws surprising light on a history that, until now, has remained in the shadows. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-03-07","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Addiction & Recovery","url":"18573371011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/009753/bk_blak_009753_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51APh-6cpIL","asin":"B01DYRK5BO","subHeading":"A Short History of Drugs and War","title":"Shooting Up","authors":"Lukasz Kamienski","narrators":"Ricco Fajardo","length":"13 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51BoLuUQ7ZL","asin":"B00V70V5IS","title":"KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps","authors":"Nikolaus Wachsmann","narrators":"Paul Hodgson","length":"31 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"51E9YZ7OF9L","asin":"B00BFT8OI0","title":"The Nuremberg Trial","authors":"John Tusa, Ann Tusa","narrators":"Ralph Cosham","length":"25 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"51kBtg+PybL","asin":"1478998997","subHeading":"Charles Manson, the CIA, and the Secret History of the Sixties","title":"Chaos","authors":"Tom O'Neill, Dan Piepenbring","narrators":"Kevin Stillwell","length":"16 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51LylAjqIWL","asin":"B003VWJAPA","subHeading":"A History of Nazi Germany","title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich","authors":"William L.

He provides illuminating vignettes that underscore how shifting social, economic, and political circumstances affected individual lives and international events.

Discretion is advised. </b></p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, <i>The Sandman </i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-07-15","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000747/or_orig_000747_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61CrEYL26KL","asin":"B01LWUJKQ7","title":"Norse Mythology","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Neil Gaiman","length":"6 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51LE+fvC0FL","asin":"B0055274U2","title":"American Gods: The Tenth Anniversary Edition (A Full Cast Production)","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Ron McLarty, Daniel Oreskes, full cast","length":"19 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"41yNdwUu5PL","asin":"B00354ZSS2","title":"Neverwhere","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Neil Gaiman","length":"13 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"510WThv+gfL","asin":"B0036KV7Y4","title":"Good Omens","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett","narrators":"Martin Jarvis","length":"12 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51amebjWx1L","asin":"B00ELIREBK","subHeading":"A BBC Radio Full-Cast Dramatisation","title":"Neverwhere","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Christopher Lee, James McAvoy, Natalie Dormer, and others","length":"3 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51IcA0avFYL","asin":"B00T6R5OM2","title":"Lovecraft's Monsters","authors":"Neil Gaiman, Ellen Datlow (Editor)","narrators":"Bernard Clark","length":"15 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"516MN+bKViL","asin":"0593396960","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Ready Player Two","authors":"Ernest Cline","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"13 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51f3UPrSPSL","asin":"B002V1OF70","title":"Dune","authors":"Frank Herbert","narrators":"Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and others","length":"21 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"516MBV-Qq6L","asin":"B00LXHQO22","title":"The Graveyard Book: Full-Cast Production","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Neil Gaiman, Derek Jacobi, Robert Madge, and others","length":"8 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51dlzyPQrFL","asin":"B002V8LI0U","title":"Anansi Boys","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Lenny Henry","length":"10 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"51FGAt5DIZL","asin":"1797121758","title":"Later","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Seth Numrich","length":"6 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51vksp09TJL","asin":"B0077DEH7A","title":"The Stand","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"47 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"41a7Qlnb5wL","asin":"1452184712","title":"Mythos","authors":"Stephen Fry","narrators":"Stephen Fry","length":"15 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51vcFtW2S3L","asin":"B005FRGT44","title":"Ready Player One","authors":"Ernest Cline","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"15 hrs and 40 mins"},{"cover":"51WhLuOA-ML","asin":"059334023X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Midnight Library","authors":"Matt Haig","narrators":"Carey Mulligan","length":"8 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"61ZBDjHc9oL","asin":"B01N9I6ES5","title":"Stardust","authors":"Neil Gaiman","narrators":"Aisling Loftus, Alex Macqueen, Blake Ritson, and others","length":"2 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51ZeCBpO33L","asin":"B07NRSYGHX","title":"The Complete Fiction of H.P.

This series of 24 enlightening lectures explains the traditional historical view of who the Celts were, then contrasts it with brand-new evidence from DNA analysis and archeology that totally changes our perspective on where the Celts came from. European history and culture have been profoundly affected by the Celts, from the myth of King Arthur to the very map of the United Kingdom, where the English confronted the peoples of the \"Celtic Fringe.\"</p> <p>With a wealth of historical expertise, Professor Jennifer Paxton (PhD Harvard University), Director of the University Honors Program and Clinical Assistant Professor of History at The Catholic University of America, guides you through each topic related to Celtic history with approachability and ease as you unearth what we once thought it meant - and what it may actually mean - to be Celtic. Professor Paxton's engaging, often humorous delivery blends perfectly with the facts about the Celts to uncover surprising historical revelations. The ancient Celts are very much alive in the literary and artistic traditions that their descendants have both preserved and very deliberately revived. All facets of Celtic life, past and present, are addressed by Professor Paxton, who demonstrates a masterful knowledge and carefully separates fact from myth at every turn. Come along for a ride through history to discover your inner Celt.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","releaseDate":"2018-03-31","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"length":"12h 52m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Europe","url":"18573582011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/000988/bk_tcco_000988_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51Rc3SCnZVL","asin":"B078HDSHQJ","title":"The Rise of Rome","authors":"The Great Courses, Gregory S.

Professor Hans-Friedrich Mueller, of Union College in Schenectady, New York, makes this ancient world come alive in 24 lectures with captivating stories of intrigue, artifacts, illustrations, and detailed descriptions from primary sources of intriguing personalities.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the ancient Mediterranean area, religion was not separate from daily life. To the contrary, religion was daily life. The many dozen gods of this ancient world were everywhere, with spirits inhabiting every crack and crevice of life. These polytheists believed they had a strict contract with their deities: If they took care of their gods, their gods would take care of them (or at least not harm them). Consequently, they built extraordinary temples to honor their deities, brought food and wine to them, sacrificed animals for them, and held sacred meals with their gods. In fact, they followed numerous rules and regulations that circumscribed almost all aspects of life both inside and outside the home - anything and everything to keep the gods happy. Consequently, the religious practices of the ancient Mediterranean make a wonderful lens through which to develop a deeper understanding of their world.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-02-28","publishers":[{"name":"The Great Courses"}],"categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tcco/001174/bk_tcco_001174_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Lecture","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51vWmWn7-5L","asin":"B07C3B6MNN","subHeading":"Life in the Cradle of Civilization","title":"Ancient Mesopotamia","authors":"The Great Courses","narrators":"Professor Amanda H.

This is a chance for Sherlock fans to see their detective hero and his creator as they’ve never seen them before. Through interviews with Doyle aficionados, academics, actors and family members, we explore Doyle’s travels and sailing adventures across the globe, his pioneering work as a doctor, his life in the Freemasons and his fights against miscarriages of justice. As well as his many triumphs, we will also explore the challenges he faced, from the death of his first wife and son to the initial rejection he faced as an author.&nbsp;</p> <p>We will also look beyond Sherlock to Doyle’s other great works including his fantasy and science fiction novels and hear how one of his most famous, <i>The Lost World</i>, part-inspired Michael Crichton’s book of the same name, which became the successful Jurassic Park film franchise.</p>","releaseDate":"2019-05-23","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"2h 5m

It lasted 3,000 years, longer than any other on the planet. Its Great Pyramid of Cheops was the tallest building in the world until well into the 19th century and remains the only Ancient Wonder still standing. And it was the most technologically advanced of the ancient civilizations, with the medical knowledge that made Egyptian physicians the most famous in the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet even after deciphering its hieroglyphs, and marveling at its scarabs, mummies, obelisks, and sphinxes, Egyptian civilization remains one of history's most mysterious, as \"other\" as it is extraordinary. This chronological survey presents the complete history of ancient Egypt's three great Kingdoms: the Old Kingdom, when the pyramids were built and Egypt became a nation under the supreme rule of the pharaoh and the rules of Egyptian art were established; the Middle Kingdom, when Egypt was a nation fighting to restore its greatness; and the New Kingdom, when all the names we know today-Hatshepsut, Tutankhamen, Ramses the Great, Cleopatra, and others-first appeared. Professor Brier's 48 lectures glisten with the kind of vivid anecdotes and human glimpses that make this ancient world breathe again.</p> <p>\"The fun of history is in the details,\" he notes. \"Knowing that Ramses the Great was crippled by arthritis for the last decade of his long life makes us more sympathetic to the boastful monarch who fathered more than 100 children.

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: \"Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza. Some stories are lifetimes.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-07-02","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18572092011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000943/or_orig_000943_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"514CDvM4UoL","asin":"B07RT12V4Q","title":"Life Ever After","authors":"Carla Grauls","narrators":"Raúl Castillo, Nana Mensah, Piper Goodeve","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51pgZWQepWL","asin":"B0842XRT7P","title":"African-American Athletes Who Made History","authors":"Louis Moore, The Great Courses","narrators":"Louis Moore","length":"4 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51GKoszPFmL","asin":"B085F3F6CX","title":"Stuck","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","asin":"B082MQ5TDB","title":"Phreaks","authors":"Matthew Derby","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","title":"When You Finish Saving the World","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51sWmdvLSzL","asin":"B08DDD5V8J","subHeading":"Raising Kids During a Pandemic","title":"Childhood, Interrupted","authors":"Sanjay Gupta MD","narrators":"Dr. Sanjay Gupta","length":"46 mins"},{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51NK159FbkL","asin":"B089T5SW3N","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime","authors":"Dan Rather","narrators":"Dan Rather","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"516mu-GabiL","asin":"B08DG7X16V","subHeading":"A Journey Through Lyrics & Life","title":"Bluebird Memories","authors":"Common, Awoye Timpo, NSangou Njikam","narrators":"Common","length":"1 hr and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51I5GD+LgIL","asin":"B088FG552H","subHeading":"A Novella","title":"Once More upon a Time","authors":"Roshani Chokshi","narrators":"Rebecca Gibel, Shiromi Arserio, Vikas Adam","length":"3 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51rd998J9OL","asin":"B07KG3SWGL","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Henrietta & Eleanor: A Retelling of Jekyll and Hyde","authors":"Robert Louis Stevenson, Libby Spurrier - dramatist","narrators":"Holliday Grainger, Clive Mantle, Carla Mendonça, and others","length":"2 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51Ai-zC5tnL","asin":"B07X1TGC2Z","title":"Herbie","authors":"Rich Cohen","narrators":"Rich Cohen","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"61y6bE1d2wL","asin":"1549150499","subHeading":"The Fetch Phillips Archives, Book 1","title":"The Last Smile in Sunder City","authors":"Luke Elliot Arnold","narrators":"Luke Elliot Arnold","length":"7 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"515rYqmg0qL","asin":"B076TC9ZQV","subHeading":"Tales of Gods, Goddesses, and Heroes","title":"Celtic Mythology","authors":"Philip Freeman","narrators":"Gerard Doyle","length":"7 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51TpY7YIpdL","asin":"B002V0JTCW","subHeading":"The Chronicles of Narnia","title":"The Magician's Nephew","authors":"C.S.

He was fortunate to have been taught to read by his slave owner mistress, and he would go on to become one of the major literary figures of his time. He wrote three versions of his autobiography over the course of his lifetime and published his own newspaper. His very existence gave the lie to slave owners: with dignity and great intelligence, he bore witness to the brutality of slavery.&nbsp;</p> <p>Initially mentored by William Lloyd Garrison, Douglass spoke widely, often to large crowds, using his own story to condemn slavery. He broke with Garrison to become a political abolitionist, a Republican, and eventually a Lincoln supporter. By the Civil War and during Reconstruction, Douglass became the most famed and widely traveled orator in the nation. He denounced the premature end of Reconstruction and the emerging Jim Crow era. In his unique and eloquent voice, written and spoken, Douglass was a fierce critic of the US as well as a radical patriot. He sometimes argued politically with younger African Americans, but he never forsook either the Republican party or the cause of Black civil and political rights.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this remarkable biography, David Blight has drawn on new information held in a private collection that few other historian have consulted, as well as recently discovered issues of Douglass’ newspapers. Blight tells the fascinating story of Douglass’ two marriages and his complex extended family. Douglass was not only an astonishing man of words, but a thinker steeped in Biblical story and theology. There has not been a major biography of Douglass in a quarter century. David Blight’s <i>Frederick Douglass</i> affords this important American the distinguished biography he deserves.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-10-16","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Cultural, Ethnic & Regional","url":"18571958011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/008913/bk_sans_008913_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"517dEtb7gVL","asin":"B074F447V6","title":"Grant","authors":"Ron Chernow","narrators":"Mark Bramhall","length":"48 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51NdfRHzbfL","asin":"B015CYJON2","subHeading":"An American Slave","title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass","authors":"Frederick Douglass","narrators":"Raymond Hearn","length":"4 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"517OUjk0WlL","asin":"1977336043","subHeading":"The Civil War in American Memory","title":"Race and Reunion","authors":"David W.

Try having one for a boss, or co-worker. That’s the predicament Andrea Vernon finds herself in as the heroine of Alexander C. Kane’s debut audiobook. Drowning in debt, and forced to move back into her parents’ Queens apartment, Andrea starts looking for a job. Luckily for her, she finds herself recruited—well, really kidnapped—by the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (C.U.P.), an organization that deploys superheroes. Suddenly Andrea must contend with co-workers who can shoot lightning from their fingertips, face the imminent destruction of humanity, and juggle a fledgling romance with a giant lumberjack. It’s all in a day’s work for the would-be novelist turned superstar secretary.</p> <p>Audible Hall of Fame narrator Bahni Turpin is perfectly cast as a normal person finding herself in abnormal circumstances. Turpin brings to life an entire cast of quirky characters, along with their heroically funny antics in the cubicle next door.

Through decades of music by one of the best-selling musicians of all time, who created classics like \"Fire and Rain\" and \"Carolina in My Mind\", James Taylor has doled out his history in the poetry of his work. Taylor says his early life is, \"the source of many of my songs\", and <i>Break Shot</i> is a tour of his first 21 years in rich, new detail. Praised by Forbes magazine as going \"beyond the spoken word\", <i>Break Shot </i>combines storytelling, music and performance to create a one-of-a-kind listening experience. Longtime fans will savor a crop of musical gems, including an unreleased recording of the beloved hymn \"Jerusalem\", selections from his newest release <i>American Standard</i>, as well as new original scoring by Taylor specially recorded for <i>Break Shot</i> and more from the Grammy Award-winning artist.</p> <p>Recorded in his home studio, The Barn in western Massachusetts, Taylor tells the deeply personal story of his youth, which is entwined with the story of his family. What started as an idyllic tight unit soon became a family sent to different emotional corners - like a break shot in the game of pool, he says, when you slam the cue ball into the fifteen other balls and they all go flying off. By the time Taylor released his breakout second album in 1970, <i>Sweet Baby James</i>, he had seen the disintegration of his parents’ marriage and his family crumble in the aftermath. He had committed himself twice to a psychiatric hospital, battled depression, a heroin addiction, suffered a relapse, and traveled far away from the wood smoke and moonshine of the North Carolina landscapes in which he came of age. Despite it all, he was also on the cusp of super-stardom and on his way to bringing light and joy to millions. He was 21.</p> <p>Journey with James Taylor to a time before he became a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee, a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors and both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Arts - and a beloved voice to millions.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-01-31","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"18571910011"},{"name":"Music","url":"18571942011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000937/or_orig_000937_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51asnHGkyYL","asin":"B007FWKZK6","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"A Natural Woman","authors":"Carole King","narrators":"Carole King","length":"14 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51xASJ4U9zL","asin":"B005CJA99Q","subHeading":"The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY and the Lost Story of 1970","title":"Fire and Rain","authors":"David Browne","narrators":"Sean Runnette","length":"11 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"41QNn+uS3mL","asin":"B083MVZ91Y","subHeading":"How Caffeine Created the Modern World","title":"Caffeine","authors":"Michael Pollan","narrators":"Michael Pollan","length":"2 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"61aOkjfK1gL","asin":"B0167DFJOA","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"Boys in the Trees","authors":"Carly Simon","narrators":"Carly Simon","length":"13 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51DZeZw7K0L","asin":"0593294181","title":"Greenlights","authors":"Matthew McConaughey","narrators":"Matthew McConaughey","length":"6 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51ubEtGvm1L","asin":"B08DVCMY4Y","subHeading":"Speaking Truth to Power Through Stories and Song","title":"Tom Morello at Minetta Lane Theatre","authors":"Tom Morello","narrators":"Tom Morello","length":"1 hr and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51o+qu3L3PL","asin":"1549185594","title":"The Last Days of John Lennon","authors":"James Patterson, Casey Sherman, Dave Wedge","narrators":"Matthew Wolf, K.

Then it’s time for the tales to begin....</p> <p>You’ll laugh along to \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" as you listen to the havoc wreaked by a father’s impish gift to his son, read by Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" will take you on a quest through an enchanted garden, alongside three witches and a luckless knight, read by Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>In \"The Warlock’s Hairy Heart\", you’ll be warned about a young warlock who is fearful of love and turns to dark magic to avoid it at all costs, read by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>The calamitous meeting of a foolish king, a cunning charlatan and a mischievous washerwoman unravels in \"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\", read by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley - Harry Potter).</p> <p>And finally, the most iconic of Beedle’s stories. \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" - with its message of humility and wisdom - will introduce you, dear listener, to the Deathly Hallows, read by Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger - <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>, London’s West End and New York’s Broadway).</p> <p>Each of the tales is accompanied by wise and whimsical notes from a certain Albus Dumbledore, surely everyone’s favourite headmaster, read by Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore - Fantastic Beasts films).</p> <p>We’re told these five fables have been firm favourites in wizarding households for centuries, and now it’s your turn to experience these tales from the Wizarding World, as you’ve never heard them before.</p> <p><i>At least 90 percent of the proceeds* received by Pottermore Limited from this audiobook will be made available by the publisher to The Lumos Foundation for their work to help children worldwide out of institutions, so they can thrive in loving families and communities. The Lumos Foundation is a charity registered in England and Wales with registered charity number 1112575.</i></p> <p>Around the world, more than eight million children live in orphanages and other institutions. What may be surprising is that about 80 percent of them aren’t actually orphans. They have family who could care for them, with the right support. Lumos is an international children’s charity founded by J.K. Rowling. Named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, Lumos’ mission is to ensure that by 2050 all children will grow up in loving, protective families.</p> <p>*Proceeds means the cash-price or cash-equivalent price less sales taxes and reasonable expenses.&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-03-31","publishers":[{"name":"Pottermore Publishing"}],"length":"1h 35m ","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Fairy Tales, Folk Tales & Myths","url":"18572258011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/potr/000526/bk_potr_000526_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61HxW4sQfZL","asin":"B01N4S7VVP","subHeading":"Read by Eddie Redmayne","title":"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them","authors":"J.K.

We see it everywhere---from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, from the assassination of Kennedy to the death of Diana. In this age of terrorism we live in, the role of conspiracy is a serious one---one that can fuel radical or fringe elements to violence. For award-winning journalist David Aaronovitch, there came a time when he started to see a pattern among these inflammatory theories. </p> <p>He found that these theories used similarly murky methods with which to insinuate their claims: they linked themselves to the supposed conspiracies of the past (\"it happened then so it can happen now\"); they carefully manipulated their evidence to hide its holes; and they relied on the authority of dubious academic sources. Most important, they elevated their believers to membership of an elite---a group of people able to see beyond lies to a higher reality. But why believe something that entails stretching the bounds of probability so far? Surely it is more likely that men did actually land on the moon in 1969 than that thousands of people were enlisted to fabricate an elaborate hoax. </p> <p>In this entertaining and enlightening book---aimed at providing ammunition for those who have found themselves at the wrong end of a conversation about moon landings or the twin towers---Aaronovitch carefully probes and explodes a dozen of the major conspiracy theories. In doing so, he examines why people believe them and makes an argument for a true skepticism---one based on a thorough knowledge of history and a strong dose of common sense. </p>","releaseDate":"2010-02-26","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"length":"14h 25m ","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"World","url":"18573695011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/001283/bk_tant_001283_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61pRP7Xt88L","asin":"1705237908","subHeading":"Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories","title":"Suspicious Minds","authors":"Rob Brotherton","narrators":"Charles Constant","length":"8 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51By6ntT9UL","asin":"B004IPC5XS","subHeading":"A True Story of Medicine, Science, and Fear","title":"The Panic Virus","authors":"Seth Mnookin","narrators":"Dan John Miller","length":"10 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51EmRv-hB-L","asin":"1250203139","subHeading":"American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power","title":"Republic of Lies","authors":"Anna Merlan","narrators":"Suehyla El-Attar, Anna Merlan - introduction","length":"10 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"41vWYdQRoEL","asin":"044980755X","subHeading":"The Investigation of Donald Trump","title":"True Crimes and Misdemeanors","authors":"Jeffrey Toobin","narrators":"Rob Shapiro","length":"18 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51Jo35+hA4L","asin":"0698402197","subHeading":"William Cooper, the Rise of Conspiracy, and the Fall of Trust in America","title":"Pale Horse Rider","authors":"Mark Jacobson","narrators":"Ray Porter","length":"13 hrs and 53 mins"},{"cover":"51rJ1iGIGIL","asin":"1630150525","subHeading":"The Real History of the Assassination of Robert F.

She danced until she was carried away six days later, and soon 34 more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had been stricken by the mysterious dancing plague. In late-19th-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome - a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure. And in turn-of-the-century New York, an Irish cook caused two lethal outbreaks of typhoid fever, a case that transformed her into the notorious Typhoid Mary. </p> <p>Throughout time, humans have been terrified and fascinated by the diseases history and circumstance have dropped on them. Some of their responses to those outbreaks are almost too strange to believe in hindsight. <i>Get Well Soon</i> delivers the gruesome, morbid details of some of the worst plagues we've suffered as a species, as well as stories of the heroic figures who selflessly fought to ease the suffering of their fellow man. With her signature mix of in-depth research and storytelling, and not a little dark humor, Jennifer Wright explores history's most gripping and deadly outbreaks, and ultimately looks at the surprising ways they've shaped history and humanity for almost as long as anyone can remember. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-02-07","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"length":"7h 44m ","categories":[{"name":"Health & Wellness","url":"18573370011"},{"name":"Medicine & Health Care Industry","url":"18573441011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/009643/bk_blak_009643_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51X3on2a-pL","asin":"B0176PGIYI","subHeading":"Thirteen of the Worst Breakups in History","title":"It Ended Badly","authors":"Jennifer Wright","narrators":"Hillary Huber","length":"8 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51R-bzs61nL","asin":"B075Y1KNTZ","subHeading":"Joseph Lister's Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine","title":"The Butchering Art","authors":"Lindsey Fitzharris","narrators":"Ralph Lister","length":"7 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"51ExnsBJ8sL","asin":"1977381359","subHeading":"An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time","title":"The Great Mortality","authors":"John Kelly","narrators":"Matthew Lloyd Davies","length":"12 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"61kew+CjP8L","asin":"B07DPW9MV6","subHeading":"A Brief History of the Worst Ways to Cure Everything","title":"Quackery","authors":"Lydia Kang, Nate Pedersen","narrators":"Hillary Huber","length":"10 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"4117S2SOtIL","asin":"052564217X","subHeading":"And Other Curiosities from the History of Medicine","title":"The Mystery of the Exploding Teeth","authors":"Thomas Morris","narrators":"Thomas Morris, Ruper Farley","length":"9 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51yKVJzVZjL","asin":"1974922693","subHeading":"Filthy Palaces, Fatal Cosmetics, Deadly Medicine, and Murder Most Foul","title":"The Royal Art of Poison","authors":"Eleanor Herman","narrators":"Susie Berneis","length":"10 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"41tYBiCFB8L","asin":"B07NQNQX14","subHeading":"How Plants, Powders, and Pills Have Shaped the History of Medicine","title":"Ten Drugs","authors":"Thomas Hager","narrators":"Angelo Di Loreto","length":"8 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61C0Ve4iDPL","asin":"B07C35RV3F","subHeading":"A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes","title":"Human Errors","authors":"Nathan H.

If I don't give EVERYONE the utmost respect and understanding, I'm not doing justice to this brilliantly compassionate book.'

Maggie Gyllenhaal (<i>The Dark Knight</i>, <i>The Honourable Woman</i>) cites Tolstoy's epic as one of her favorite books of all time, and her love for the literature permeates her performance. <i>Anna Karenina</i> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-07-12","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/023146/bk_adbl_023146_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"41fiQBv7XSL","asin":"1799744698","title":"War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition)","authors":"Leo Tolstoy, Louise Maude - translator, Aylmer Maude - translator","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"55 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"61xeZR4o-eL","asin":"B006GDCIY6","title":"War and Peace (Russian Edition)","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","narrators":"Evgeniy Ternovskiy","length":"73 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51ZSmls3ILL","asin":"B002V9ZF3K","title":"Crime and Punishment","authors":"Fyodor Dostoevsky, Constance Garnett (translator)","narrators":"Anthony Heald","length":"20 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51y-ivhKErL","asin":"B016LN23CC","title":"Pride and Prejudice","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"514jjttxNfL","asin":"B076PPDCYD","subHeading":"An Audible Exclusive Performance","title":"Wuthering Heights","authors":"Emily Brontë, Ann Dinsdale - introduction","narrators":"Joanne Froggatt, Rachel Atkins - introduction","length":"12 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51q0JL4Ev+L","asin":"B002V8HN40","title":"Anna Karenina","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","narrators":"David Horovitch","length":"38 hrs"},{"cover":"51Y1Wy710HL","asin":"B01COOZ5C2","title":"Jane Eyre","authors":"Charlotte Bronte","narrators":"Thandiwe Newton","length":"19 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"415JZg55HjL","asin":"1799744744","title":"The Brothers Karamazov (AmazonClassics Edition)","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett - translator","narrators":"James Anderson Foster","length":"34 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51DpA-g11JL","asin":"B00EZAXAF8","title":"The Brothers Karamazov [Naxos AudioBooks Edition]","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett - translator","narrators":"Constantine Gregory","length":"37 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"611yjzGc8DL","asin":"B018Y1861G","title":"Brat'ya Karamazovy","authors":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","narrators":"Yury Grigoriev","length":"49 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61EpaXzme6L","asin":"B005DTEE2I","title":"The Master and Margarita [Russian Edition]","authors":"Mikhail Bulgakov","narrators":"Vladimir Ivanovich Samoylov","length":"16 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51O9i9zCWbL","asin":"B006C570EQ","title":"Crime and Punishment [Russian Edition]","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","narrators":"Vyacheslav Gerasimov","length":"23 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"512aPCc91oL","asin":"B06XX2WGQL","title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Nick Offerman","length":"13 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51hEu1Yyp-L","asin":"B006CQBT6U","title":"The Idiot (Russian Edition)","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","narrators":"Vyacheslav Gerasimov","length":"29 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"61-3iQELiiL","asin":"B00EY38WKY","title":"Crime and Punishment","authors":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky","narrators":"Constantine Gregory","length":"22 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"41kSzPrKTqL","asin":"0241487870","subHeading":"Penguin Classics","title":"Anna Karenina","authors":"Leo Tolstoy, Richard Pevear - translator, Larissa Volokhonsky - translator","narrators":"Miranda Pleasence","length":"36 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51fnOrXtPPL","asin":"B071KWPQTJ","title":"The God of Small Things","authors":"Arundhati Roy","narrators":"Sneha Mathan","length":"11 hrs and 45 mins"},{"cover":"61YuwY8sM-L","asin":"B08JZF5T49","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"The Jane Austen Collection","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Claire Foy, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billie Piper, and others","length":"45 hrs"}],"added":11},{"asin":"B00FEFE4XK","cover":"51gU3fCeigL","title":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes: The Heirloom Collection","authors":[{"name":"Arthur Conan Doyle","url":"B000AQ43GQ"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Simon Vance"}],"blurb":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes tales are rightly ranked among the seminal works of mystery and detective fiction.","downloaded":true,"progress":"53h 8m left","titleShort":"The Complete Sherlock Holmes","ratings":7833,"rating":4.7,"summary":"<p><b>Winner of the 2014 Audie Award for Classics</b> </p> <p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes tales are rightly ranked among the seminal works of mystery and detective fiction.

Billions of years ago, a godlike race unlocked all the secrets of space and time and remade the universe according to their grand design. Then they vanished and left behind the Well World to maintain the pattern of the universe. </p> <p>Now someone is searching for the planet’s hidden control room - the Well of Souls - to seize control of the cosmos. Nathan must stop them, but this planet causes bizarre metamorphoses in visitors, changing them into centaurs, mermaids, and giant insects seemingly at random.

His task seems hopeless - until his long-suppressed memories begin to return and he realizes who he really is.</p>","releaseDate":"2013-05-01","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Audio, Inc."}],"length":"13h 57m ","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/005627/bk_blak_005627_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51cabjbnpNL","asin":"B00CJBYODC","title":"Exiles at the Well of Souls","authors":"Jack L.

Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse - unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind.&nbsp;</p> <p>All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki - whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.</p>","releaseDate":"2003-12-09","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"33h 46m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/000349/bk_rand_000349_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"511+DbzTZ+L","asin":"B0036NQ9Z8","subHeading":"A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3","title":"A Storm of Swords","authors":"George R.
